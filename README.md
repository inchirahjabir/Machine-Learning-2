# Machine Learning 2 Labs

Welcome to the Machine Learning Labs repository for the Machine Learning 2 course! This repository contains Python scripts and data files for the labs completed as part of the course. Please note that I didn't use any machine learning library (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn) for these labs. All implementations were done from scratch.

## Course Description

The main objective of this course is to guide students to have a solid basis in Machine Learning in Computer Science. The development of such a basis is possible by designing the present course so that students will learn the theory, reason themselves on the learned topics, apply the theory by implementing it from scratch (programming in Python), and share the gained knowledge with their peers. This course covers from the initial to intermediate levels of Machine Learning with applications in various domains.

## About the Labs
The labs completed for this course cover the following topics:

1. **Lab 1: Feedforward Neural Network (Supervised Learning):** This lab involves implementing a feedforward neural network from scratch to solve a multi-class classification problem. It covers concepts such as forward propagation, backpropagation, and optimization technique

2. **Lab 2: Reinforcement Learning:** In this lab, you will explore reinforcement learning algorithms, particularly Q-learning. You will see an implementation of Q-learning to find the optimal value function and policy function for a given environment.

3. **Lab 3: K-means:** This lab focuses on clustering techniques, specifically the K-means algorithm. You will find an implementation of K-means from scratch, and applied  to cluster data points in a given dataset. Visualization of clustering results is also included.

4. **Lab 4: PCA (Principal Component Analysis):** This lab is about dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). You will find an implementation of PCA from scratch and its application to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset. Visualization of principal components and transformed data is part of the lab.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/inchirahjabir/Machine-Learning-2.git\
```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
```bash
